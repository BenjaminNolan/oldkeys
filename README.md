# Oldkeys - Typing dead languages in modern OSen

This project came out of a lack of easily-findable decent-quality keyboard
layouts for typing languages such as Latin, Norse, and Old English properly in
their original forms (eg, vici mālum malum, ᚺᚨᚾᚾ ᚨ ᚺᚨᛗᚨᚱ ᚷᛟᚦᚨᚾ, þæt wæs god
cyning, etcetera) and contains a series of keyboard layouts and their localised
variants for the following languages:

* Old English — 
> HǷÆT! ǷE GARDE
> na inƿear daᵹum þeod cẏnninᵹa
> þrẏm ᵹe frunon huða æþelinᵹaſ ellen
> fremedon.

## Building from source

### Windows

You will need Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator. You can find this from various
sources, none of which are Microsoft any more, as they haven't supported it
since Windows 7 and recently removed it from their site. :(

## License

The code in this repo is MIT licensed. If you do make additions or changes to
the layouts included here, please do feel free to PR them back so we can keep
things up-to-date and as high quality as possible. :)
